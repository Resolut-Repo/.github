Resolut is a semi-stealth startup offering an innovative platform to manage and resolve music copyright issues at scale. In an industry undergoing seismic shifts—where AI developers face scrutiny over unlicensed use of creative works—rights holders are demanding greater transparency and control. Traditional licensing frameworks, such as those established under the Music Modernization Act of 2018, struggle to accommodate rapid streaming growth and emerging AI use cases. Meanwhile, researchers highlight a chronic shortage of centralized, high-quality music metadata, impeding transparent rights tracking at the scale required by today’s catalogs. Resolut addresses these challenges by combining AI-driven analytics, centralized metadata orchestration, and streamlined dispute workflows in a unified, user-friendly environment.

# Overview

At Resolut, our mission is to make rights management effortless for music professionals by providing a single interface for all ownership verification and conflict resolution tasks. Powered by next-generation AI, our platform transforms dense contracts and fragmented ownership logs into clear, actionable summaries. By focusing exclusively on music copyright resolution, we deliver a level of precision that surpasses general-purpose legal or licensing tools.

# Key Benefits
	•	Scale with confidence: Handle catalogs of any size and geographic scope without additional overhead
	•	Enhance transparency: Maintain an auditable chain-of-title record for every asset, ensuring every transfer is documented and searchable ￼
