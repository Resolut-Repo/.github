In today’s music industry, rights holders navigate a landscape of spreadsheets, email threads and dispersed metadata sources, which makes conflict resolution slow, error prone and expensive. Resolut provides a unified platform that centralizes every claim, document and data source in one secure workspace, eliminating operational silos and scaling with catalogs of any size ￼. The platform integrates chain of title records and metadata with real time conflict monitoring to deliver clarity and control at every stage ￼. Guided workflows automate routine tasks and audit logs record each action to ensure compliance readiness and reduce legal risk ￼.

## ↓ Mission

Resolut was founded in Nashville in 2024 to solve the persistent challenge of manual music copyright conflict resolution ￼. Where teams once toggled between multiple editing tools and email platforms to resolve disputes, Resolut offers a single source of truth. The platform supports configurable workflows, permission controls and real time alerts so that teams can react swiftly to new or recurring issues ￼. Secure access controls and encrypted document storage protect sensitive legal records while preserving an immutable audit trail for every change ￼.
